# v2025.10.23 - CanineCore stabilization, PackMind docs restructure, and legacy tests archived
> Author: 7Lynx Â· Doc Version: 2025.10.24

Release tag: `v2025.10.23`

## Highlights
- CanineCore switched to Python-based configuration via `CanineConfig` with presets (Simple, Patrol, Interactive).
- Deprecated the old YAML configuration path; `core/services/config.py` now hard-errors to guide users to the new config.
- Consolidated PackMind documentation under `packmind/packmind_docs/` with an updated architecture guide.
- Archived all legacy test scripts to `legacy/` (removed `_test` suffix) and updated the root `README.md` accordingly.
- Minimal fixes applied to legacy scripts to avoid obvious undefined-name/type errors.

## Changes
### Added
- Centralized JSON logging in CanineCore via `utils/logging_setup.py` and the logging service, with rotation controls.
- `legacy/README.md` describing the status of archived scripts.

### Changed
- `canine_core/core/orchestrator.py` now uses `CanineConfig` and supports optional preset selection. If no explicit queue is provided, it derives the run queue from `AVAILABLE_BEHAVIORS`.
- Updated CanineCore docs (`canine_core/README.md`, `canine_core/canine_core_config_guide.md`) to reflect Python-based config and remove YAML references.
- PackMind docs moved to `packmind/packmind_docs/` (including architecture and configuration guides).

### Deprecated
- `canine_core/core/services/config.py` deprecated; raises an error directing to `canine_core/config/canine_config.py`.

### Removed
- YAML-based configuration loader pathway in CanineCore.
- `tests/` directory (archived to `legacy/`).

### Notes
- Legacy bridge modules under `canine_core/core/` (e.g., `global_state.py`, `memory.py`, `state_functions.py`, `master.py`) remain for backward compatibility.
- Legacy scripts are not actively maintained and may require hardware or environment setup. They have minimal fixes to avoid basic runtime errors where feasible.

## Upgrade notes
- If you previously referenced YAML config, switch to `canine_core/config/canine_config.py` and use the provided presets or construct a `CanineConfig` instance in code.
- If you automated against the old `tests/` directory, update any paths to `legacy/`.

## Tag summary
Same as tag message:
- CanineCore switched to Python-based CanineConfig presets; deprecated YAML loader.
- Updated CanineCore docs and config guide.
- Consolidated PackMind docs under `packmind/packmind_docs`.
- Archived tests to `legacy/` (removed `_test` suffix); updated README and added `legacy/README.md`.
- Minor fixes in legacy scripts to avoid undefined names/type errors.
