"""
USAGE INSTRUCTIONS FOR PIDOG CONFIGURATION SYSTEM
================================================

The PiDog AI system now uses a separate configuration file (packmind_config.py) that allows 
you to easily customize your PiDog's behavior without touching the main AI code.

## QUICK START

1. Edit the file: packmind/packmind_config.py
2. Modify values in the PiDogConfig class 
3. Restart your PackMind script to apply changes
4. Use preset configurations or create your own

## CONFIGURATION PRESETS

The system includes 4 ready-made configurations:

### DEFAULT MODE (PiDogConfig)
- All features enabled with balanced settings
- Good for general use and testing

### SIMPLE MODE (SimpleConfig) 
- Minimal features, conservative behavior
- No SLAM mapping, no advanced AI
- Perfect for basic operation or limited hardware

### ADVANCED MODE (AdvancedConfig)
- All features enabled, aggressive exploration  
- Fast movement, close obstacle thresholds
- Best for demonstrations and outdoor use

### INDOOR PET MODE (IndoorPetConfig)
- Home-friendly settings with learning
- Gentle movement, quieter volume
- Safe distances, emotional responses

### EXPLORER MODE (ExplorerConfig)
- Focused on mapping and navigation
- High-frequency SLAM updates
- Moderate speeds for consistent mapping

## HOW TO USE PRESETS

### Method 1: Voice Commands (Runtime Switching)
- "PiDog, simple mode" - Switch to SimpleConfig
- "PiDog, advanced mode" - Switch to AdvancedConfig  
- "PiDog, indoor mode" - Switch to IndoorPetConfig
- "PiDog, explorer mode" - Switch to ExplorerConfig
- "PiDog, show config" - Display current configuration

### Method 2: Edit packmind_config.py Default
Find this line at the bottom of packmind/packmind_config.py:
```python
# Change this to set your default configuration
DEFAULT_CONFIG = "default"  # Options: default, simple, advanced, indoor, explorer
```

### Method 3: Custom Configuration
Create your own configuration class in packmind_config.py:
```python
class MyCustomConfig(PiDogConfig):
    # Your custom settings here
    SPEED_NORMAL = 90
    ENABLE_VOICE_COMMANDS = False
    # etc...
```

## RUNTIME MODE SWITCHING

You can switch between preset configurations during operation using voice commands:

- "PiDog, simple mode" - Switch to SimpleConfig (minimal features)
- "PiDog, advanced mode" - Switch to AdvancedConfig (all features)
- "PiDog, indoor mode" - Switch to IndoorPetConfig (home-friendly)
- "PiDog, explorer mode" - Switch to ExplorerConfig (mapping focus)
- "PiDog, show config" - Display current configuration name and key settings
- "PiDog, status" - Show system status and active features

## SPEED AND TURN CALIBRATION

### Voice Command Testing
Use these voice commands to test and calibrate movement:

- "PiDog, test walk slow/normal/fast" - Test walking speeds
- "PiDog, test turn 45/90/180" - Test turn angles

### Speed Calibration Process
1. Test current speeds: "PiDog, test walk normal"
2. If too slow: Edit SPEED_NORMAL in packmind_config.py (try 140-150)
3. If too fast: Edit SPEED_NORMAL in packmind_config.py (try 100-110)
4. Restart PiDog AI to apply changes
5. Test turns: "PiDog, test turn 90"
6. Adjust TURN_90_DEGREES in packmind_config.py if not accurate (5-7 steps typical range)
7. Update TURN_DEGREES_PER_STEP accordingly

### Natural Movement Guidelines
- Turn speeds should be faster than walk speeds for natural appearance
- SPEED_TURN_NORMAL should be 1.5-2x SPEED_NORMAL
- 3 steps at speed 200 ≈ 45° turn (baseline for calibration)
- Adjust TURN_DEGREES_PER_STEP in packmind_config.py to match your surface and PiDog
- All speed settings are in packmind_config.py for easy editing

## CONFIGURATION FILE SETUP

### Initial Setup
1. Run: `python tools/setup_pidog.py` (setup assistant with dependency checking)
2. Edit: `packmind/packmind_config.py` to customize settings
3. Test: `python packmind/packmind_config.py` (validates configuration)
4. Run: `python packmind/orchestrator.py`

### PackMind Checkup (on the Pi)
Use the checkup tool to verify imports and service initialization after you change a module.

```bash
# Import every PackMind module to catch import errors
python3 tools/packmind_checkup.py --scope import

# Safe service initialization (no movement)
python3 tools/packmind_checkup.py --scope services --preset simple

# Include ScanningService head sweep (limited movement)
python3 tools/packmind_checkup.py --scope services --move --preset simple
```

### Configuration Testing
```bash
# Test configuration validity
python packmind/packmind_config.py

# Test all presets (Python one-liner)
python - <<PY
from packmind.packmind_config import load_config, validate_config
for name in ['default','simple','advanced','indoor','explorer']:
    print(name, ':', validate_config(load_config(name)))
PY
```

### Creating Custom Configurations
Add your custom configuration class to packmind_config.py:

```python
class MyCustomConfig(PiDogConfig):
    """My personalized PiDog settings"""
    
    # Override any settings you want to change
    SPEED_NORMAL = 90
    OBSTACLE_IMMEDIATE_THREAT = 22.0
    ENABLE_EMOTIONAL_SYSTEM = False
    VOICE_VOLUME_DEFAULT = 60
    
    # All other settings inherit from PiDogConfig
```

Then use it by adding to the config_map in load_config():
```python
config_map = {
    # ... existing presets ...
    "custom": MyCustomConfig,
}
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Configuration Issues
- **Config file not found**: System uses embedded fallback configuration
- **Invalid settings**: Check `python packmind/packmind_config.py` for validation warnings
- **Runtime errors**: Use voice command "PiDog, simple mode" for basic operation

### PiDog moves too fast/slow
- Edit SPEED_NORMAL, SPEED_FAST, SPEED_SLOW in packmind_config.py
- Use voice test commands to calibrate: "PiDog, test walk normal"
- Consider surface type (carpet vs hardwood affects speed)
- Try different presets: "PiDog, simple mode" (slower) or "PiDog, advanced mode" (faster)

### PiDog too cautious/reckless
- Adjust OBSTACLE_IMMEDIATE_THREAT distance in packmind_config.py
- Modify OBSTACLE_APPROACHING_THREAT for earlier warnings
- Try different presets: "PiDog, simple mode" (cautious) or "PiDog, advanced mode" (aggressive)

### Voice commands not working
- Check ENABLE_VOICE_COMMANDS = True in packmind_config.py
- Install: pip install SpeechRecognition pyaudio
- Adjust WAKE_WORD if needed
- Test with: "PiDog, status"

### SLAM/Navigation not working
- Check ENABLE_SLAM_MAPPING = True in packmind_config.py
- Install: pip install numpy
- Enable ENABLE_AUTONOMOUS_NAVIGATION for pathfinding
- Try "PiDog, explorer mode" for mapping-focused behavior

### Performance issues
- Use SimpleConfig: "PiDog, simple mode"
- Edit packmind_config.py: Disable ENABLE_PATROL_LOGGING to save storage
- Edit packmind_config.py: Increase OBSTACLE_SCAN_INTERVAL to reduce CPU usage
- Edit packmind_config.py: Disable ENABLE_SENSOR_FUSION if not needed

### Memory issues
- Switch to SimpleConfig preset: "PiDog, simple mode"
- Edit packmind_config.py: Disable ENABLE_VOICE_COMMANDS
- Edit packmind_config.py: Disable ENABLE_SLAM_MAPPING
- Edit packmind_config.py: Set LOG_MAX_ENTRIES to smaller value (e.g., 500)

### Dependency Issues
- Run setup assistant: `python setup_pidog.py`
- Install missing packages as recommended
- Use appropriate preset for your hardware capabilities

## CONFIGURATION VALIDATION

The system automatically validates your configuration and provides warnings for:
- Speed values exceeding servo limits (0-255)
- Turn speeds slower than walk speeds (unnatural movement)
- Inconsistent obstacle detection distances
- Feature dependencies (e.g., sensor fusion requires SLAM)
- Performance impact warnings

Run `python packmind/packmind_config.py` to see validation results for all presets.

## SUMMARY

The new configuration system provides:
- **Easy editing**: All settings in one file (packmind_config.py)
- **Preset configurations**: 4 ready-made modes for different use cases
- **Runtime switching**: Change modes via voice commands
- **Automatic validation**: Warns about configuration issues
- **Setup assistant**: Helps check dependencies and recommend settings
- **Fallback system**: Works even if config file is missing

This makes PiDog much easier to customize without touching complex AI code!
