# Legacy scripts

This folder contains archived scripts migrated from the old `tests/` directory. They are kept for reference and may require hardware, environment setup, or supporting modules that are not part of the current CanineCore or PackMind systems.

Notes:
- Filenames were renamed to remove the `_test` suffix.
- Minimal fixes were applied to avoid obvious import/name/type errors, but functionality is not guaranteed.
- These scripts are not actively maintained. Prefer using the CanineCore behaviors or the PackMind orchestrator.

If you want to run any of these on a PiDog, review the code, add any missing dependencies, and test carefully.
