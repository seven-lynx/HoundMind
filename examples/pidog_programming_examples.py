Complete PiDog Programming Examples - BEGINNER FRIENDLY! 
=========================================================

üéì PERFECT FOR BEGINNERS! üéì

This file contains working code examples for EVERY PiDog feature.
Each example is explained step-by-step so complete beginners can understand.

üöÄ How to use this file:
1. Run it: python3 pidog_programming_examples.py  
2. Choose an example from the menu
3. Watch your PiDog perform the action
4. Look at the code to see HOW it works

üéØ What you'll learn:
- Basic movement commands (sit, stand, walk)
- Head and tail control  
- Reading sensors (touch, ultrasonic, IMU)
- LED light effects
- Sound interactions
- Advanced behaviors and AI patterns

‚ö†Ô∏è Safety First:
- Always have space around your PiDog
- Keep the emergency stop button ready (Ctrl+C)
- Start with slow speeds when testing
