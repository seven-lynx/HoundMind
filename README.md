# HoundMind — Advanced Behaviors and AI for SunFounder PiDog 🐶

HoundMind is the umbrella project that provides two related but completely independent ways to run your PiDog:

- CanineCore: a modular behavior framework for composing and interactively running behaviors.
- PackMind: a standalone AI with its own orchestrator, services, and optional mapping/navigation stack.

Use either system. They don’t import or depend on each other.

Note: We’ve adopted the name “HoundMind” for the overall project brand. Module/package names (CanineCore, PackMind) remain unchanged for compatibility.

Legacy modules for the old system are stored in Legacy, and the entire project has been forked at https://github.com/DrMikeKW/Pidog-New_Scripts/

## What’s inside

- CanineCore (`canine_core/`): async orchestrator, services (motion, sensors, emotions, voice), and behavior modules.
- PackMind (`packmind/`): AI orchestrator plus subsystems for mapping (SLAM), navigation (A*), localization (sensor fusion), voice, scanning, and obstacle handling.
- Docs (`docs/`): programming guides, API reference, voice setup, and config guides.
- Examples (`examples/`): runnable examples.
- Legacy (`legacy/`): archived test modules and examples (not actively maintained)

## Quick install and run on the Raspberry Pi 🧰

Requirements

- Raspberry Pi with PiDog assembled and powered
- Raspberry Pi OS (Bookworm or compatible), Python 3.9+
- Official `pidog` package (and related hardware libs) installed on the Pi

1) Clone the repo on the Pi

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/seven-lynx/HoundMind.git
cd HoundMind
```

2) Install Python dependencies

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Optional: enable voice features

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio
pip3 install speech_recognition pyaudio
```

3) Run one of the systems

PackMind (standalone AI)

```bash
python3 packmind/orchestrator.py
# or
python3 packmind.py
```

CanineCore (modular behaviors)

```bash
python3 main.py                # Orchestrator default
python3 canine_core/control.py # Interactive behavior menu
```

Tip: On a development PC without hardware, many hardware services fallback to safe no-ops. Camera/audio/servos still require proper setup when you move to the Pi.

## Which should I choose?

- PackMind: batteries‑included AI demo that coordinates sensing, emotions, scanning, and optional mapping/navigation.
- CanineCore: clean, composable framework to mix and match behaviors and services; ideal for building your own modules.

## Features at a glance

- Voice commands with optional wake word (when enabled)
- Intelligent scanning and obstacle avoidance
- Behavior orchestration and state handling
- Emotional LED themes and reactive sounds
- Optional SLAM mapping, A* navigation, and sensor‑fusion localization (PackMind)

## Developer quick start (desktop) 💻

On Windows (PowerShell) or macOS/Linux, you can explore without hardware:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py                  # CanineCore
python packmind/orchestrator.py # PackMind
```

Note: Hardware‑dependent features won’t function fully without PiDog.

## Documentation

- Programming Guide: `docs/PIDOG_PROGRAMMING_GUIDE.md`
- Quick Start Programming: `docs/QUICK_START_PROGRAMMING.md`
- API Reference: `docs/api_reference.md`
- Voice Setup: `docs/voice_setup_instructions.md`
- CanineCore configuration: `docs/canine_core_config_guide.md`
- PackMind architecture: `packmind/ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Troubleshooting

- If `pidog` imports fail on the Pi, install the official SunFounder libraries and verify servo calibration.
- For voice issues, confirm `portaudio19-dev` and `pyaudio` are installed and a default input device is set.
- On desktops without hardware, expect safe no‑ops for hardware calls.
