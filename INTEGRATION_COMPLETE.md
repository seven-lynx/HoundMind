- Multi-directional sound source detection and tracking
- Advanced voice activity detection with frequency analysis
- Background noise calibration and adaptive silence detection
- Sound classification (Voice/Footsteps/Mechanical/Environmental/Alarm/etc.)
- Integration with emotional system (triggers EXCITED for voice, ALERT for loud noises)

**Configuration**: 18 parameters covering hardware setup, voice detection, sound tracking

## üîó **FULL ORCHESTRATOR INTEGRATION**

### **Service Lifecycle Management**
- **Initialization**: All services automatically start when enabled in configuration
- **Runtime Integration**: Periodic polling and event integration in main AI behavior loop
- **Shutdown**: Proper cleanup and data saving on system shutdown
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with hardware simulation fallback

### **Emotional System Integration**
```python
# Face Recognition ‚Üí Emotional Responses
Recognized Face ‚Üí EmotionalState.HAPPY
Unknown Face ‚Üí EmotionalState.EXCITED

# Balance Monitoring ‚Üí Safety Responses  
Critical Balance ‚Üí EmotionalState.ALERT
Balance Recovery ‚Üí EmotionalState.CALM

# Audio Processing ‚Üí Interaction Responses
Voice Detected ‚Üí EmotionalState.EXCITED
Loud Noise ‚Üí EmotionalState.ALERT
```

### **Patrol Event Logging**
All service events are automatically logged with:
- Timestamps and confidence scores
- Service metadata and performance metrics
- Integration with existing patrol report system
- Real-time behavior state correlation

## ‚öôÔ∏è **CONFIGURATION SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS**

### **Service Enable Flags Added**
```python
ENABLE_FACE_RECOGNITION = True    # Face detection and recognition
ENABLE_DYNAMIC_BALANCE = True     # IMU balance monitoring  
ENABLE_ENHANCED_AUDIO = True      # Multi-source audio processing
```

### **Preset Configuration Specialization**

**SimpleConfig**: 
- All new services disabled for basic operation
- Focus on core PiDog functionality

**AdvancedConfig**:
- All services enabled with enhanced settings
- 48kHz audio sampling, 30Hz balance monitoring
- Aggressive face detection (0.5 threshold, 5 faces/frame)

**IndoorPetConfig**:
- Face recognition and audio enabled for family interaction
- Balance monitoring for safety during indoor play
- Family-friendly detection thresholds

**ExplorerConfig**:
- Balance and audio enabled for outdoor terrain navigation
- Face recognition disabled to focus on mapping
- Environmental awareness prioritization

## üìö **COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION**

### **Configuration Guide Updates**
**File**: `packmind/packmind_docs/PackMind_Configuration_Guide.txt` (updated)

- Detailed parameter explanations for all 41 new configuration options
- Recommended settings and tuning guidelines
- Hardware setup instructions and troubleshooting
- Integration examples and usage patterns

### **Dependency Management**
**File**: `requirements.txt` (updated)

Added essential libraries:
- `face-recognition>=1.3.0` - Facial recognition processing
- `dlib>=19.24.0` - Computer vision backend
- `pidog>=1.0.0` - Hardware interface library
- Enhanced audio processing dependencies

## üß™ **INTEGRATION TESTING**

### **Comprehensive Test Suite**
**File**: `test_service_integration.py` (220 lines)

**Test Coverage**:
- Service import validation
- Configuration loading for all presets  
- Service initialization and API validation
- Orchestrator integration verification
- Error handling and graceful degradation

**Test Results**: Configuration system passes all tests (hardware-dependent tests expected to fail on development machines)
